# Composer Skeleton
A boilerplate codebase to get a composer package going quickly.

1. Clone this project: `git clone <remote-url>`
0. Delete the `.git` directory: `rm -r .git`
0. Add the new remote git project: `git remote add origin <remote-url>`
0. Modify the composer file.
0. Install dependencies: `composer update`
0. Change the license if needed.
0. Have at it!
